            <p><h4>Shaniwar Wada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune, India. Built in 1732,[1] it was the great seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818. Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the center of Indian politics in the 18th century.
             The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.

                An equestrian statue of Peshwa Baji Rao I, Prime Minister of the Maratha Empire, in the Shaniwar Wada complex. He was the first resident of the fortified palace.
                The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. It was supposed to be made entirely of stone but after the completion of the base floor or the first story, the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Shahu(King) saying that a stone monument can be sanctioned and built only by the Shahu(King) himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and not stone. Even today if you visit and see the walls carefully, they are partly made of stone and partly by bricks. The Wada was then completed and upon being attacked by the British Artillery 90 years later, all the top six stories collapsed leaving only the stone base, which was immune to the British artillery. Hence only the stone base of the Shaniwar Wada remains and can be seen even today in the older parts of Pune.

                Peshwa Baji Rao I, prime minister to Chattrapati Shahu, laid the ceremonial foundation of his own residence on Saturday, 10 January 1730. It was named Shaniwar Wada from the Marathi words Shaniwar (Saturday) and Wada (a general term for any residence complex). Teak was imported from the jungles of Junnar, stone was brought from the nearby quarries of Chinchwad, and Lime (mineral) was brought from the lime-belts of Jejuri. Shaniwarwada was completed in 1732, at a total cost of Rs. 16,110, a very large sum at that time.[11]
                The opening ceremony was performed according to religious customs, on 22 January 1732, another Saturday chosen for being a particularly auspicious day.\\Later the Peshwas made several additions, including the fortification walls, with bastions and gates; court halls and other buildings; fountains and reservoirs. Currently, the perimeter fortification wall has five gateways and nine bastion towers, enclosing a garden complex with the foundations of the original buildings. It is situated near the Mula-Mutha River, in Kasba Peth.<br><br>

               <b><h3>Shaniwar Wada has five gates:</h3>

                <h2>Delhi Darwaza</h2>
                <center class="zoom"><img src="delhi darwaja.jpg" width="350" height="600" align="center" border="3"></center><br><br>
                The Delhi Darwaza is the main gate of the complex, and faces north towards Delhi. Infact, Shaniwar Wada is the only fort structure in India to have its main gate facing Delhi, the mideaval imperial capital of Mughal Empire. Even Chhatrapati Shahu is said to have considered the north-facing fort an indication of Baji Rao's ambitions against the Mughal Empire, and suggested that the main gate should be made of chhaatiiche, maatiche naahi!
                
                <h2>Mastani Darwaza (Mastani's Gate) or Aliibahadur Darwaja, facing north</h2>
                This gate was used by Bajirao I's wife Mastani while travelling out of the palace's perimeter wall.
                Khidki Darwaza (Window Gate), facing east
                
                <h2>Khidki Darwaja (Window Gate)</h2>
                <center class="zoom"><img src="khidkidarwaja.jpg" width="300" height="450" align="center" border="3"></center><br><br>
                The Khidki Darwaja is named for an armoured window it contains.

                <h2>Ganesh Darwaza (Ganesh Gate), facing south-east</h2>
                Named for the Ganesh Rang Mahal, which used to stand near this door. It could be used by ladies at the fort to visit the nearby Kasba Ganapati temple.
                
                <h2>Jambhul Darwaza or Narayan Darwaja (Narayan's Gate), facing south</h2>
                This gate was used by concubines to enter and leave the fort. It obtained its second name after Narayanrao Peshwa's corpse was removed from the fort for cremation through this gate.
                
                <h1>The Fountain</h1>

                The complex had an impressive lotus-shaped fountain: the Hazari Karanje (Fountain of a thousand jets).<br> It was constructed for the pleasure of the infant Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao. It was designed as a sixteen petal lotus; each petal had sixteen jets with an eighty-foot arch. It was the most complicated and intricate fountain of its time.
